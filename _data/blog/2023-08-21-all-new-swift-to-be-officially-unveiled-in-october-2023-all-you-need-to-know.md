Suzuki is working on the all-new Swift, which is likely to debut in the global market by the end of this year. The fifth-generation Suzuki Swift, which sells under the Maruti Suzuki brand in India will come in an all-new avatar including a new engine.

Judging by the overall silhouette and dimensions of the car, it is evident that the vehicle concealed beneath the covers is the upcoming generation of the popular Suzuki Swift. Although the car has been spotted on European roads, its debut will initially occur in Asian markets, including Japan and India. The car’s appearance indicates its readiness for production, suggesting a potential release sometime in the latter half of 2023.

## Swift to retain its design

Regarding its design, the new Suzuki Swift presents a more compact and grounded stance. Anticipated to feature a more sophisticated design, it boasts a broader and sleeker front grille, as well as refined headlamps and tail lamps. Notably, the camouflaged model displayed rear door handles integrated into the door panels, departing from the current generation’s recessed C-pillar placement. Moreover, the absence of the C-pillar black tape, which imparts the illusion of a floating roof in the present version, signifies Suzuki’s inclination towards traditional styling cues for the new Swift.

The fresh Suzuki Swift also exhibits more vertical pillars and fewer contours on its side profile, aligning it with the hatchback’s first and second generations. However, the flares behind the rear fenders appear more pronounced, rendering the new Swift a broader appearance compared to its predecessors. Furthermore, the rear window panels, which have historically been relatively modest across all Swift generations, appear to have grown in size, a modification expected to contribute to a more open cabin ambiance.

Although the precise Indian release date remains uncertain, the new model will unquestionably elevate its offerings by incorporating new-generation features from recent Maruti Suzuki launches such as the Baleno and Brezza. The list of features is set to expand, encompassing additions like a larger 9-inch Smartplay Pro+ touchscreen infotainment system, a wireless charger, a head-up display, and six airbags, among others. However, the engine option will persist with the existing 1.2-liter four-cylinder K12C Dualjet petrol engine, propelling the present Swift model. Available with both a 5-speed manual and AMT gearbox, this engine generates 90 PS of power and 113 Nm of torque.
