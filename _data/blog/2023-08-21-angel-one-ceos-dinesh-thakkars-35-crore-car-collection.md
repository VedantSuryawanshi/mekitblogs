Dinesh Thakkar’s GT3 Touring

Dinesh recently shared the images of his brand new Porsche 911 GT3 Touring sports car. The car is finished in a Crayon finish, and the wheels are satin Neodyme wheels. This car is powered by a 4.0-liter flat 6 engine that generates 502 PS and 470 Nm of peak torque. The power is sent to the rear wheels. Unlike the regular GT3, the Touring variant does not get the rear spoiler, giving it a cleaner look. The price for a Porsche 911 GT3 Touring is around Rs 2.75 crore, ex-showroom.

**Lamborghini Urus**

Dinesh Thakkar’s Urus

The Lamborghini Urus caught the attention of rich customers around the world almost immediately. It was one of the fastest-selling Lamborghinis in India and around the world. Dinesh also owns one in a shade of silver. The price for a brand new Urus SSUV starts at Rs 4.17 crore, ex-showroom, and depending on the customizations you choose, the price differs.

**Ferrari 488 Pista**

Dinesh Thakkar’s Ferrari 488 Pista

This is one of his favorite track cars, and he is often spotted driving it in Mumbai. Dinesh owns the car in Ferrari’s signature red shade. It is powered by a 3.9-liter turbocharged engine that generates around 710 bhp and 770 Nm of peak torque. It was named the most powerful V8 engine in the history of Ferrari and has a top speed of 340 kmph.

**Lamborghini Huracan Performante**

Dinesh Thakkar’s Lamborghini Huracan

This one costs around Rs 4 crore, ex-showroom. Dinesh owns the car in a green shade, which looks extremely sporty on the car. The car is powered by a 5.2-liter V10 naturally aspirated petrol engine that generates 640 bhp and 600 Nm of peak torque. The engine is mated to a 7-speed automatic transmission, and all this power is sent to the rear wheels.

**Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series**

Dinesh Thakkar’s AMG GT Black Series

This is the most powerful AMG ever built. Only 2 units of this car have come to India. The first unit of the AMG GT Black Series was sold to a known businessman, Boopesh Reddy, and the second one, finished in Magma Beam Orange shade, was bought by Dinesh. The price starts at Rs 5.5 crore, ex-showroom. This is a track-focused beast and uses a V8 engine to generate 730 Ps and 800 Nm of peak torque. It is mated to a 7-speed DCT gearbox.

**Porsche 911 GT3 RS**

Dinesh Thakkar’s 911 GT3 RS

This is a much meaner-looking machine than the recently bought GT3 Touring. It is, once again, a track-focused machine with a big spoiler on the rear. Dinesh owns a 2019 model GT3 RS in a black shade. It uses a 4.0-liter flat 6 engine that generates anywhere between 500-520 Ps.

**Mercedes-AMG G63**

Dinesh Thakkar’s AMG G63

It looks like Dinesh likes to experiment with colors for his cars. His Mercedes-AMG G63 is actually finished in a very unique shade of orange, which is something we have not seen in India. The car is said to have been imported directly from Germany. This appears to be the previous generation G63, which used a massive 5.5-liter bi-turbo engine that generated 544 Bhp and 760 Nm of peak torque.

**Mini Cooper**

Dinesh Thakkar’s Mini Cooper

Among all these giants, there is a red-colored Mini Cooper parked in the garage of Dinesh Thakkar. This is probably the least expensive car that the Indian businessman has in his garage.

**Porsche Taycan Turbo S**

He bought India’s first Porsche Taycan Turbo S electric sports car. This 4-door electric car is finished in an exclusive Green Mamba shade.
