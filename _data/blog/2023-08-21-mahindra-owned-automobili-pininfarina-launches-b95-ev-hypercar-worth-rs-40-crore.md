Automobili Pininfarina unveiled this exclusive hypercar at the Monterey Car Week, which is one of the most iconic automotive events organized in Monterey, California, in the United States of America. This all-new model has been created to commemorate Pininfarina’s upcoming 95th Anniversary in 2025; hence the number 95 in the name B95. And as for the B in the name of this hypercar, it stands for Barchetta, which in Italian means “little boat” and also a car that does not have a traditional roof or windshield at the front.

### Exterior

Like its name, the B95 is an extremely unique hypercar and features an open-top roadster design. This car does not get a traditional roof, and as mentioned and evident from the pictures, it also does not get a windshield. According to the company, its design is based on the PURA Vision concept, which was an all-electric SUV designed by Pininfarina. The front end of this hypercar features an extremely aggressive bumper and a very unique air dam, along with very sleek-looking all-LED headlights.

This all-electric EV hypercar also features electronically adjustable aero screens inspired by vintage fighter planes. According to the company, these aero screens are a world first, and they have been designed in-house. The side profile of this car is equally unique and features a sculpted body with sleek air channels throughout. The car also features massive multi-spoke alloy wheels.

Moving on to the rear of the car, it can be noted that it features two massive air domes placed right behind the headrests of the driver and the passenger. These air domes have been designed to take in air and direct it towards the rear and inside of the car to make it more aerodynamic and cool the EV powertrain inside. The rear end of the car also features very thin and sleek LED taillights, which seem to be connected but are not. The rear end design is dominated by the massive rear diffuser, which houses some sharp fins that increase the aerodynamic capabilities of this EV hypercar.

### Interior

As for the interior, just like the exterior, it is also very unique and features a distinctive blend of vintage and modern design. Automobili Pininfarina has given the B95 a dual-tone interior that features tan-colored leather sourced from sustainable sources. The B95 also gets black-anodized buttons and parts along with a ton of carbon fiber throughout. Adding to the uniqueness of this car’s interior, along with tan leather, it also gets the iconic Houndstooth fabric. Additionally, the B95 also gets laser-engraved aluminum details.

### Powertrain

Powering this EV hypercar is the same drivetrain that powers the Pininfarina Battista. The Pininfarina B95 has been equipped with four electric motors, each placed at the four wheels of the car, giving it all-wheel-drive capability. This car, with its four powerful electric motors, will be able to generate a maximum of 1900 PS of power and will be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2 seconds. According to the company, the car will come equipped with a 120 kWh battery pack, which can be charged with up to 270 kW. This enables the car to be charged from 20% to 80% in just 25 minutes.
