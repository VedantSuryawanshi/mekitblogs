The Hyundai Verna, which is proudly made in India, has just aced the Global NCAP crash test, scoring a solid 5 stars for both adult and child occupant safety. This achievement marks a significant milestone for Hyundai as it becomes the first Indian-made Hyundai car to achieve this top rating.

This accomplishment is part of the #SaferCarsForIndia campaign, which is all about making cars safer for Indian roads. The campaign is set to wrap up soon, just in time for the activation of Bharat NCAP later this year.

Now, let's break down what this 5-star rating means. Global NCAP conducts rigorous crash tests that evaluate how well a car protects its occupants during frontal and side impacts, and it also looks at Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Additionally, the safety of pedestrians and protection against side impact poles is considered for vehicles aiming for the highest star ratings.

The Hyundai Verna, which was tested with the basic passive safety features like 6 airbags and ESC as standard, managed to secure those coveted 5 stars for both adults and children. However, it's worth noting that the car's structure was found to be somewhat unstable after a side impact test, and there was a Child Restraint System (CRS) failure observed. Fortunately, after a more intense side impact test, the CRS showed no further signs of failure.

In a move that prioritizes safety, Hyundai Motor India has announced that all models sold in India will now come with 6 airbags as standard, across all variants. Yes, you heard it rightâ€”even the most affordable car in the Hyundai India lineup, the Grand i10 Nios, will offer this enhanced safety feature from its base variant.

Unsoo Kim, the Managing Director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India Limited, expressed the company's commitment to safety, stating, "At Hyundai, 'Safety-for-all' is our utmost priority." He emphasized that Hyundai is not just about providing smart mobility solutions but also safer ones.

Alejandro Furas, the Secretary General of Global NCAP, welcomed Hyundai to the five-star club in the Indian market and praised their efforts to improve safety performance in emerging markets. He encouraged Hyundai to continue this trend and bring advanced safety technologies to more of their models.

David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation, highlighted the importance of this achievement in the context of the #SaferCarsForIndia campaign. He stressed the significance of maintaining a strong safety momentum in the Indian auto industry.

In addition to the Hyundai Verna, other cars that have received 5 stars in India under the new Global NCAP crash test protocol include Volkswagen Virtus, Skoda Slavia, Skoda Kushaq, Volkswagen Taigun, and Mahindra Scorpio-N.

So, it's reassuring to see automakers like Hyundai taking significant steps towards making our roads safer, and we can't wait to see how other cars perform in upcoming crash tests as part of this safety campaign. Stay tuned for more updates on the safety front in the Indian automotive industry!
