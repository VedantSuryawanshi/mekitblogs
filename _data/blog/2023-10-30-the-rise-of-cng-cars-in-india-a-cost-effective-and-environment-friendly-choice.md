Car ownership in India is getting more expensive because of high fuel prices, costly vehicles, and increased maintenance costs. People are looking for solutions to ease the financial burden, and they've found an answer in new technologies like electric vehicles and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) cars. These alternatives promise lower ownership costs compared to traditional petrol and diesel vehicles. Plus, they are environmentally friendly, which is becoming more important as we address vehicle emissions.

CNG cars were initially popular in commercial vehicles, starting with buses and trucks. But now, they're making their way into taxis and even private vehicles. The demand for CNG cars in India has been skyrocketing. Despite a 49% increase in CNG prices, sales of CNG vehicles shot up by 40.7% in the previous financial year, according to a report by CARE Ratings. Currently, CNG cars make up about 12% of the Indian passenger vehicle market â€“ a significant chunk.

What's behind this CNG car revolution in India?

**1. Confidence Boost**: As more CNG cars hit the market, Indian consumers are gaining confidence in this alternative. They see the benefits and are making the switch.

**2. Automaker Support**: The growing demand for CNG cars has encouraged automakers to introduce new models with factory-fitted CNG kits. It's a win-win situation for everyone.

**3. Cost Savings**: CNG is much cheaper than petrol or diesel, which is a massive incentive for budget-conscious consumers. With rising fuel costs, CNG is an attractive option.

**4. Expanding Infrastructure**: The increase in CNG filling stations across India makes it more convenient for people to own CNG cars. You don't have to worry about running out of fuel.

**5. Cleaner Emissions**: CNG cars produce substantially fewer emissions compared to petrol or diesel vehicles, contributing to a cleaner environment.

**6. Dual-Fuel Convenience**: CNG cars can run on both petrol and CNG, providing flexibility for drivers.

The government is also pushing this trend forward by setting up more CNG filling stations. In 2019, there were about 1,900 CNG filling stations in India, and now there are nearly 6,000. The plan is to have 17,700 CNG filling stations across the country by 2030. The government is committed to increasing the share of CNG as an energy source to 15% by 2030.

Puneet Gupta, Director of S&P Global Mobility, believes the availability of CNG filling stations and government support are driving CNG car sales in India. He thinks CNG cars are a practical choice for fleet customers, especially with the high prices of hybrid and electric cars. Avik Chattopadhyay, a former Volkswagen India executive, sees the lower cost of running and ownership as a key factor in the rise of CNG cars. People are choosing CNG as a way to save money, and it's an excellent option for both personal vehicle owners and fleet operators.

In a world where owning a car is becoming more expensive, CNG cars offer a breath of fresh air with their cost savings and environmental benefits. The CNG revolution in India is on the rise, and it's a win for both consumers and automakers.
